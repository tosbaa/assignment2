1.1) 0 824 0   Succes rate = %56
     0 2317 0  Total Missclasification errors = 1760
     0 936 0   Comment = Gaussian had less success rate than the multinomial and bernoulli methods
                    for integer type of data multinomial is the most proper method


1.2) 0 640 0   Success rate = %57
     0 1804 0  Total Missclasification errors = 1373
     0 733 0   Comment = Three of the methods extract the same results, when number of samples get increased, gausian could perform better

2.1) Length - Diameter - Height

     0 2317 0  Total Missclasification errors = 1760
     0 936 0   Comment = With just three features we got the same results as we did with all features. Performace is hugely increased
